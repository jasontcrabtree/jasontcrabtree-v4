summary: Finding a balance between a deep interest in design, AND a deep interest in the code that makes the design work
title: Website Code? Website Design? Both?
---

Several interesting articles I've been reading and thinking about lately as I consider my focus â€” mostly writing code for designs I've done as I work as a Freelance Designer and Developer.

-   [Front-of-the-front-end and back-of-the-front-end web development](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/)
-   [On Design Engineering: I think I might be a design engineer...](https://www.trysmudford.com/blog/i-think-im-a-design-engineer/)
-   [The Great Divide (of Front-End Developers)](https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/)

The current outcome of this thinking is two CV's, and respecting each aspect of the [website making] process more and more.
