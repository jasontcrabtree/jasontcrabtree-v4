title: Combining Tools: Thoughts on using NextJS and .NET as the Basis of A Web App
---

(I intended to write this immediately after finishing the project, but as with all good intentions here I am six months later. The lessons still hold, while the technical details will be sparse!)

If you have been anywhere near front-end web development in the last five years, you've heard of React and you've likely heard of NextJS, a framework built on top of React. I think Next is great, especially if you haven't been exposed to the technologies it enables such as server-side functions (serverless), authentication (next-auth) and server-side rendering. As great as it is though, sometimes you have to be where the jobs are — and in New Zealand, that means a lot (lot lot) of .NET.

With that in mind, CRM Clone helped me achieve a goal of mine during a recent job search, get reps using Next 14 and build a backend server and API using .NET, and a very healthy amount of ChatGPT. Overall, the project went well, I'm really happy with the outcomes, ChatGPT exceeded all expectations, and I won' ever use ChatGPT in the same way again. The other tools are definitely staying in my toolbox for future use though! More on that to come.

## The concept

Following in the footsteps of tech tutorials like "Trello Clone" or "Twitter Clone", CRM Clone implements the basic concept of a Customer Relationship Management platform (CRM). As a quick overview, a CRM is effectively a more comprehensive contacts management tool — most often orientated around two core concepts, "companies" and "contacts". I decided CRM Clone would take this core concept introduce a third domain concept, "actions".

Actions let me add a bit of product thinking to the overall product, and helped me focus around the core idea of imagining a CRM that focused on actions/interactions between existing nodes (contacts/companies), not just surfacing and adding new nodes (how most CRMs are structured).
