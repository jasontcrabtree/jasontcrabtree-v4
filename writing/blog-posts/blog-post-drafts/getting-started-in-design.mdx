summary: â€œLearning Design over the wire, a Pathway to Learning Design via Twitter"
title: My Pathway into Design
---

My pathway into design started through User Experience. I first learnt about design from afar (literally, I was in New Zealand, following people in Silicon Valley on Twitter), learning how things were done through Podcasts and Blog Posts and Books and Conference talks, from UX Designers.

Those lessons focused on user research, defining problems, understanding users, journey maps, user flows, personas, information hierarchy, flow charts and post-it notes. Methods and design techniques focused on the discovery and development of new product concepts and pencil drawn, rough mockups.
