        -   Schema.prisma generator client binaryTargerts
        -   Prisma DATABASE_URL
        -   Install Prisma as dependency
    -   next.config.js set target to 'experimental-serverless-trace'
    -   package.json postbuild command
    -   Netlify.toml
        -   command = "npm run prisma"
        -   Remove nextplugin, add as postbuild command, doesn't work
