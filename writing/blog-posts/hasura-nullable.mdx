Nullable, what's the definition? This answer is based on my own research and reading articles and docs.

Nullable GraphQL field on [Hasura definition](#definition-outcome) (specifically in the context of GraphQL):

-   **Nullable: Optional** (if data is provided, it must be the correct type, no data or _null_ is also an option)
-   **Not-nullable: Required** (_data of the correct type must be provided_)

Hasura seems great, but sometimes the docs are a little unclear to me as a beginner. One area of that is the nullable tickbox while creating new tables. I can't find a clear definition of Nullable in the UI, or the docs (just references that seem to assume you already know what it is), and googling 'Nullable' leads to C code references. So this is my thought process and googling digging for an answer I can directly understand. Definitely no guarantees I came to the correct answer, but I know which buttons work in Hasura now!

[Hasura GraphQL Nulls Cheatsheet](https://hasura.io/blog/graphql-nulls-cheatsheet/) has the following code snippet:

_TypeScript:_

```
interface User {
  name?: string // opting into optional name
  name: string | null // opting into nullable name
}
```

_GraphQL:_

```
type User {
  name: String! // opting into non-nullable name
}
```

I know from another project (working with Prisma and Postgres) that a Prisma model with ? is optional. So this code snippet to me appears to be saying, User.name? is optional, and GQL User.name has **opted** into being non-nullable. As in, it's **opted** into being non-optional, AKA required.

Above, this is explained via _"But in GraphQL, all types are nullable by default, and you opt into non-nullability."_

Which helps me understand nullable isn't directly the same as optional, but doesn't say what it is.

The same article later offers a cheatsheet, found at [Direct link to GraphQL Nulls Cheatsheet Image](https://hasura.io/blog/content/images/2020/05/graphql-nulls-cheatsheet.png).

### This offers the following info about Nulls in Graphql:

> Nullable inputs are always optional

> Non-null inputs are always required

A secondary source [Hasura Custom GraphQL Types docs](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/actions/types/index.html) offers this snippet

```
type UserInfo {
  accessToken: String!
  userId: Int!
}
```

This is an object type called UserInfo that has two fields:
accessToken: This field is of type String! (non-nullable String)
userId: This field is of type Int! (non-nullable Int)

### After some testing with Hasura, I've discovered the following:

-   A table column that is _not_ ticked as nullable (so is not-nullable) is _required_ to submit a mutation. When data is passed in to the _not ticked_ column, the mutation runs fine.
-   When the same column has nullable ticked on (making the column nullable), the same mutation can be _successfully run_, saving data, with an empty field. The field also runs when null is passed.

<h3 id="definition-outcome">So to recap where I'm at so far:</h3>

-   Not Nullable = column must have the expected type data
-   Nullable = column can be empty or set to null, or the expected type

-   Nullable in this context works like this: A graphql entry can be either empty, have the expected data, or set to null
-   Not-nullable enforces the expected data is passed

So extrapolating, a definition of nullable (specifically in the context of GraphQL on Hasura) I can understand is:

-   Nullable: Optional, correct type required, no data or _null_ is fine
-   Not-nullable: Required, correct type must be passed

15th Aug: I had the bright idea to check YouTube for Hasura Data Modelling guides, and found a great video - [Hasura YouTube Channel - Data Modelling Video, Timestamped to Nullable reference](https://youtu.be/9zi1QSrQ6Aw?t=170). In the video nullable is explained as "which means that there's going to be something that I could leave empty inside of my database, and I'm not going to run into any issues with that." This matches nicely with my own research, which is great!
