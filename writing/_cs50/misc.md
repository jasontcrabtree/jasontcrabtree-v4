## Trimming the last digit with Modelo/Remainder

Yes, you're on the right track! If you have an integer and you want to isolate the last digit, you can use the modulus operator %. For example, 12345 % 10 would give you 5.

If you want to remove the last digit from an integer, you can use integer division by 10. For example, 12345 / 10 would give you 1234.

By repeating these operations, you can process each digit of a number individually. This is a common technique in problems where you need to work with the digits of a number.

but that isn't to do with rounding?

No, the technique of using division and modulus to isolate or remove digits is not directly related to rounding. It's a separate concept. Rounding typically involves increasing or decreasing a number to the nearest whole number, which is a different operation. The technique you're referring to is often used in problems where you need to manipulate or analyze individual digits of a number.
